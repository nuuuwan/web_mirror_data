##  About
** About Transparency
International Sri Lanka  **
Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) is
a National Chapter of Transparency International (TI), the leading global
movement against corruption. TI raises awareness of the damaging effects of corruption
and works with partners in government, business and civil society to develop
and implement effective measures to tackle it. TI has an international
secretariat in Berlin, Germany, and more than 90 Chapters worldwide.
Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) commenced active operations at the
end of 2002 and has since built a strong institution arduously fighting
corruption in Sri Lanka. It functions as a self-financing, autonomous Chapter
of TI with its own strategic directions and priorities.
The mission/purpose of TISLâ€™s existence is to contribute to increase
understanding of corruption, strengthen anti-corruption structures and
processes and to appreciate the upholding of integrity. Envisioning a nation
that upholds integrity, TISLs goal is to support the collective effort to
eradicate corruption in order to build a future Sri Lanka which is equitable,
peaceful and just.
Currently this is the only publicly available database of Politically Exposed Persons of Sri Lanka, created locally. It is for the free use of the general public, journalists, activists, banking institutions, analysts and organizations.
###  Public Register of PEPs of Sri Lanka
The Online Register of Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) contains profiles of Sri Lankan individuals who fall within the PEP definition provided in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Guidance.
