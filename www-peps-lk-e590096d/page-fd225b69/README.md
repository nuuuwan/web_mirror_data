#    Online Database of     Politically Exposed Persons     in Sri Lanka
Search
A politically exposed person (PEP) is an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent public function.
PEPs can be individuals with very high levels of integrity, who are merely classified as PEPs due to the office they hold.
PEPs are however individuals who are in positions that can be potentially abused for the purpose of committing corruption, bribery, money laundering, and terrorist financing.
As a result, it is important that these individuals are recognized, and their transactions subjected to enhanced scrutiny.

###  Frequently Asked Questions
[Who is a PEP?](#collapse1)
A politically exposed person (PEP) is defined by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent public function. This definition is provided under the FATF Recommendations 12 and 22.
Due to their position and influence, it is recognised that many PEPs are in positions that  ** potentially ** can be abused for the purpose of committing money laundering (ML) offences and related offences, including corruption and bribery, as well as conducting activity related to terrorist financing (TF).
Importantly, recognizing PEPs and employing enhanced scrutiny is solely a preventive mechanism and is not intended to construe PEPs as being involved in any wrongdoing. PEPs can be individuals with very high levels of integrity, who are merely classified as PEPs due to the entrusted public function they perform.

[Why do we need an Online Register of PEPs?](#collapse4)
As recognized by the FATF, PEPs are individuals who are in positions that can be potentially abused for the purpose of committing corruption, bribery, money laundering, and terrorist financing. It is noted that as a result, it is important that these individuals are recognized, and their transactions subjected to enhanced scrutiny.
Currently Sri Lanka does not have a publicly available database that allows for the recognition of PEPs. Thus, in the public sphere there is a lack of understanding of the importance of identifying and scrutinizing their transactions for money laundering and terrorist financing risks, thereby preventing corruption.
This database seeks to bridge that gap. It is intended to be used forfree by the general public, journalists, activists, analysts and organizations for their information and analysis.
